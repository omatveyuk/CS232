Hello world app is the first ruby on rails app written using Cloud9 development environment
and deployed to heroku runtime environment using git.
The application oly prints "Hello, World" string and string with my name.
The goal of this app to learn new rails development environments.
Ruby on rails is my first framework and I find it somewhat complicated.
